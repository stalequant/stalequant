            <p>There
              are plenty of guides on building crypto trading strategies. Many are decent,
              none resonated with me. Here's my take. Five easy steps.</p>

            <p>0. Get your expectations in check</p>

            <p>1. Code a low-quality execution bot</p>

            <p>2. Build an orchestration system around that execution</p>

            <p>3. Add performance measurement system</p>

            <p>4. Use performance data to improve steps 1 to 3 until you're not terrible</p>

            <p>5. Start trying to actually make money</p>

            <p>Let's walk through these.</p>

            <p><strong id="expectations">0. Get your expectations in check</strong></p>
            <p>To start with, I don't think automated crypto trading is a path to riches. I'm not even sure it's a
              particularly good path. I have
              done very well. With that said, </p>

            <ul>
              <li> A lot of my money came from the generosity of our lord and savior who gifted his
                humble servant five lakh HYPE; and
              <li>
                I was at a top STEM PhD before burning/selling out and going to tradfi, before burning
                out and doing crypto, which puts me in a better position to make money than most
                people (god went with a glass cannon build; I'm
                also obese and diagnosed autistic);
            </ul>

            <p>If
              you exclude the HL airdrop, I've made about as much as I would
              if I money kept on my previous path. I do get a lot of flexibility and I got some
              lottery tickets one of which happened to be a winner; but I also put my own money
              on the line and got more risk / stress / loneliness.</p>

            <p>More
              generally, I don't think the crypto trading cottage
              industry has much of a future.
            <ul>
              <li>If crypto takes off, the markets will get efficient and you will be driven out by
                tradfi players who are better run, have cheaper capital, etc. They won't even want to hire you because
                the
                skills needed to
                run a trading system solo don't have a ton of crossover with the
                skills needed to work as part of a tradfi firm.
              <li>If crypto doesn't take off, it will die. You will
                need to find work at tradfi firm and they won't
                even be that interested in hiring you, not only because of the factors above but
                also because you were in a failed industry.
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Given
              that, lets get going with the good stuff. Quoting a movie as I tend to, “If he [my son] really wants a
              cigarette. I'll buy him
              his first pack.”</p>

            <p><strong id="execution-engine">1. Low Quality Execution Engine</strong></p>

            <p>Brilliant
              people have spent decades optimizing trade execution. Luckily, they haven't spent
              decades on crypto execution because crypto is so new. </p>

            <p>Your
              first step on the path I have set is to build a basic execution engine. This is
              not a trading strategy. This is not going to make money. This is a placeholder you
              will use to build out measuring and monitoring capabilities. Once you have those
              in place, you will improve this into something passable, which you will then use
              one things that actually CAN make money.</p>

            <p>I'd
              suggest you start with Hyperliquid. Why? </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The large taker speedbump makes life much easier for noobs.
              <li>
                There is still lots of retail flow, and less serious MM competition than most
                CEXs.
              <li>
                Other DEXes are too small for our purposes, other CEXs aren't really suitable. Fees kill you on
                registered
                venues,
                latency kills you as a shrimp non-Tokyo venues (OKX, Bybit), Binance is hyper-competitive,
                Bitget is a bucket shop. Many of the fun new entrants have hard to manage
                quirks. HL is the only venue with decent depth.
            </ul>

            Practical
            steps:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Put $500 into a trading account on Hyperliquid.
              </li>
              <li>
                Get the Hyperliquid Rust SDK running on your own computer (Python works too, again,
                the goal here is mostly to get something we can build our measurements around).
              </li>
              <li>
                Check my stalegun demo on GitHub. You will write a simple loop that does basically
                what that does:
                <ul>
                  <li>Watch Binance prices</li>
                  <li>Calculate the EWMA between Binance and Hyperliquid</li>
                  <li>
                    Place HL orders near Binance prices after adjusting for the EWMA, cancel them when
                    Binance moves
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                After doing that, spin up a $50/mo AWS Tokyo server, secure it, and start running
                some trades.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Make
              sure your bot can, say, take order directions from a REDIS DB and turn that into
              trades without crashing or losing too much money.</p>

            <p><strong id="orchestration">2. Orchestration</strong></p>

            <p>Now
              that you can place orders, you need scaffolding to direct that order placement and
              understand it. Build out your bot into.
            <ul>
              <li>Something that splits out orders and trades toward a target position
              <li>Risk measurement and reporting
              <li>A dashboard (NiceGUI works) to monitor performance and control your bot
              <li>PagerDuty alerts on positions
              <li>Automated circuit breakers and sanity checks
              <li>Standard logging: crashes, CPU spikes, weird API behavior, etc.
            </ul>

            <p>Why
              bother with all this for a $500 HL account making $10 trades? Because launching
              a real-money bot without this stuff would be dumb. You're testing in prod with a small account.</p>

            <p><strong id="performance-measurement">3. Performance Measurement</strong></p>

            <p>The
              third step is measuring performance. This is incredibly important, because a lot
              of what you are going to be doing is iteratively improving 1 based on the metrics
              from this. An entire industry exists for this. </p>

            <p>Big
              picture, focus on execution first.</p>

            <p>Are
              the prices you get filled at good?
            <ul>
              <li>Execution vs hypothetical Binance hedge at the microprice (hedging slippage)
              <li>Execution vs later HL microprice trades (markout)
              <li>Execution vs your model price (implementation shortfall)
              <li>Hedge performance itself, adjusted for BTC beta (hedge alpha vs systematic exposure)
              <li>Model performance (signal alpha, currently EWMA in your low-quality bot)
            </ul>

            <p>For
              all of those measures, but especially the long term measures, you want to strip
              away as much noise as possible. I tend to do this by controlling for movements in
              the Binance prices of either the crypto in question or BTC. If the Binance price
              was perfectly fair, how could be use it to reduce variance? </p>

            <p>So
              instead of doing </p>

            <p>Profit
              = Sell price - Buy price</p>

            <p>You
              decompose your returns into…</p>

            <p>Profit
              = Sell price - Price from Binance at sale - Venue adjustment + Medium term change in fair price
              on Binance due to that coin + Medium term change in fair price on Binance due to
              broad market moves - (Buy Price - Price on Binance -
              Venue adjustment)</p>

            <p>Each
              of those can be measured separately, stripping away the noise created by broad market
              moves allows you to better measure the actual gains you create.</p>

            <p>When
              you have an infra here, test the big MMs on HL. They typically make ~0.2-1 bp. If you see them making or
              losing
              huge sums, you
              are wrong.</p>

            <p>Do
              other measures look good?</p>

            <p>In
              medical trials, they often look at blood pressure rather than heart attack deaths.
              Why? Because blood pressure is easy to measure whereas heart attacks are mostly
              random and the result of long term factors. Blood pressure is a surrogate endpoint
              for the heart attacks we actually care about.</p>

            <p>Tick-to-trade
              is the primary surrogate endpoint for my execution. You want to measure the time
              from a Binance web socket post to a cancel order. You measure this not because it
              is inherently important, but because you can measure this extremely accurately.
            </p>

            <p>You
              will measure it and you will work to shorten it. But always keep in mind that your
              local deli accepts cash, not ns. You are using tick to trade ONLY because it is
              easy to measure and allows you to iterate fast. </p>

            <p>Implementation
              tips:
            <ul>
              <li>Log to Postgres
              <li>Wire metrics to dashboard
              <li>Don't calculate on hot path
              <li>Ignore actual fees at first, assume a decent fee tier. You will optimize later.
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p><strong id="git-gudder">4. Git Gud (or at Least Less Bad)</strong></p>

            <p>You
              won't get good but you can suck less. Once you have measurement and
              risk checks in place, you should be losing only a handful of basis points per trade.
              Set your bot to do a thousand trades a day (trade against the stuff that is cheap
              or expensive vs Binance) and measure what comes out. If your bot is doing dumb stuff,
              stop it from doing that dumb stuff.</p>

            <p>Tune
              your bot to improve your metrics until you get to a reasonable level. What is reasonable?
              I'd say your execution costs on small
              trades executed passively should be less than 2 basis points plus the difference
              between your fee tier and the top MM fee tier. That should be easy to hit. Keep
              in mind, you aren't trying to make money (yet), you
              are just getting to a position where you can move risk around without losing too
              much money.</p>

            <p><strong id="start-making-money">5. Start Trying to Actually Make Money</strong></p>

            <p>If
              your are making money after step 4, you screwed up. Revisit step 3.</p>

            <p>When
              you're confident you are in okay shape,
              then you pick your role. Broadly, I see a few paths to success:</p>

            <p><strong>A. Predict Prices Based on Other Venues' Prices</strong></p>

            <p>If
              something is trading at $10 on one venue and $11 on the other, there is a good chance
              one of those is wrong. The obvious trade is to buy the cheap one and sell the expensive
              one. Take that logic and scale it. </p>

            <p>Your
              first step should be to download both CCXT and Hummingbot. You want to carefully
              note every venue they support. Then you should not only DELETE both CCXT and Hummingbot,
              you should avoid EVERY SINGLE VENUE they support. If a venue is supported there,
              don't bother, you won't make money. No old venues. </p>

            <p>Why
              not? Well, for starters I'm there and even worse maybe Wintermute
              or goblin or loris or someone else better than me is there. I've been running that bot for years,
              I've tuned it, I've worked out the
              API quirks, it will be hard for you to compete. But even if your bot is BETTER than
              mine, you still won't win. Why? I'm willing to run my bots for basically zero profit.
              Even if I'm not making money today, keeping
              them going keeps my optionality, supports a platform I have a bunch of points on
              (or relationship with the team etc.), and gives me the ability to build up exposures
              I like or hedge risk from another venue. Even if you are a better coder, you can't compete with that.</p>

            <p>So
              you go to NEW PLACES. The API may be broken, there isn't that much volume, and you are slightly worried
              you
              will lose all your money. Those are bad, obviously, but the pros aren't there and even if they are
              entering,
              both you and
              the pros are starting from square one.</p>

            <p>Beyond
              the competition aspect, crypto is a game of lottery tickets. Old venues are not
              winning tickets. New venues may well be. I won with Hyperliquid, I lost with a DOZEN
              other venues. If you want to win, you need to be going to places you CAN win.</p>

            <p>On
              that new venue, you will absorb risk. Your goal is NOT to make money on every trade
              - your goal is to get into a position
              where you would make money if you perfectly hedged every trade on Binance at no
              cost. You don't HAVE to hedge, this is just a reference.
              The governing assumption is that if you are trading on some degen den, then they
              aren't adversely selecting against you
              and changes in the Binance price are just random noise. So if you get filled for
              better than Binance mids every day, the times the degens lose will more than balance
              out the times degens win.</p>

            <p>This
              risk absorption could be high frequency. For that, you likely want to specialize
              in a few venues, build up good relationships, learn the API quirks. You will optimize
              for those (few) venues, try to take 30-40% of their orderflow for a decent return.
            </p>

            <p>It
              could be low frequency, e.g., funding rate arbitrage. For this, you model the paths
              of funding rates and how much leverage you can safely take. While higher frequency
              was about depth, this is more about breath -
              you want to have more opportunities to pick from, so you want to have coverage on
              many futures venues.</p>

            <p><strong>B. Predict Prices Using Prices</strong></p>

            <p>A
              lot of people start with modeling prices using prices. It seems so tempting. You
              download the download Binance data, backtest, and are amazed at the excellent returns
              you found. </p>

            <p>Unfortunately,
              you found excellent returns because you screwed up. Rule of thumb: if you think
              you found a 3 Sharpe ratio trading on Binance using price data, you found it
              because you screwed up.</p>

            <p>Somewhat
              informally, I view the returns here as being of two types: alphas and betas</p>

            <p>Alphas
              are the price being wrong. The price of LUNC gets thrown out of whack because of
              hedging done by a weird instrument. The contract specs of a weird venue mean funding
              is paid based on an idiosyncratic formula, the market maker is dumb and hasn't realized this. A Korean
              venue
              posts listing announcements
              on its site early if you can guess the URLs.  These alphas are great but they are
              short lived and have limited capacity - markets tend toward efficiency.
              People tend not to talk about alpha because if you leak them they get traded away.</p>

            <p>Betas
              are risk premia ' momentum, reversal, funding rate
              patterns, shit coins going to zero. These are well known, big, people trade on them.
              They exist because there isn't enough smart money in crypto to
              absorb them.</p>

            <p>You
              can tell by the examples I gave that alphas usually aren't coming from prices alone
              (they can, of course). Very likely, the prices give you a clue something is going
              on. You will then keep pulling the thread until you find out the cause of the distortion.
              Then you will trade on that.</p>

            <p>Most
              of what you see in the candles will be betas. Betas are still pretty good in crypto,
              but they are there because taking the other side is unpleasant. I think ScottPh77711570
              gives a solid feel for the action technical analysis returns give. macrocephalopod
              is of course an all time great.</p>

            <p>If
              you like betas, you should try to get a bunch of somewhat different ones so the
              winners balance the losers (and keep in mind that when things go bad, everyone who
              had that genius idea will be unwinding at the same time and they will all be correlated).</p>

            <p><strong>C. Predict Prices using New Data</strong></p>

            <p>If
              you want alphas, you are more likely to find them by looking deeply into the oddities
              of market structure than you are to find them by running ML models on Binance price
              data.  </p>

            <p>The
              low tech approach here is to just do whatever you did as a degen gambler, but slightly
              better because you have less slippage using your bot. I do some of this - I type
              in my target allocation and my bots tilt my trading to move toward that allocation.
              E.g., I short MSTR and rely on my bot to hedge out the BTC risk.</p>

            <p>For
              me at least, the higher tech approaches often emerged from the lower tech approaches.
              Whenever you see something weird, you should be thinking - does this weirdness create
              an opportunity? If so, can I write code that captures this weirdness and trades
              against it every time it happens.</p>

            <p>Again,
              you want to focus on things that Wintermute ISN'T
              DOING. Sadly, this means you probably want to focus on things that DO NOT scale.
              Why? Because if it could scale, someone better than you (are now) is doing it.</p>

            <p>Buying
              Bitcoin on Binance based on a DataBento CME subscription? That isn't going to work.</p>

            <p>Buying
              HL memes to front run TWAPs or large deposits? That might work.</p>

            <p>I
              repeatedly tell people not to start trading, and to quit if they are ahead. Very
              few people have the skills required to do this well. Trading is not a zero-sum game;
              once you account for fees, spreads, slippage, and outright scams, it is a negative-sum
              game.</p>

            <p>The
              ratio of people who actually know what they are doing to people who are effectively
              doomed is extremely low. I personally make a lot of money trading, but that fact
              is not especially informative. I have also used all sorts of drugs without developing
              an addiction. If a teenager outside a liquor store asked me to buy them alcohol,
              I would not tell them that I never had a problem with opiates and that insulin needles
              are easy to buy. I would tell them to stay in school.</p>

            <p>Even
              if you <i>do</i> have the skills, trading your own account is usually a bad idea.
              If you are genuinely good enough to make money trading, you should either be doing
              something else entirely, or trading other people's money in an environment that
              allows you to scale, learn, and be challenged by a high-skill peer group. Trenching
              garbage capital does not count, and neither do most paid trading groups. The kind
              of trading that makes money in crypto, in particular, is often a dead end.</p>

            <p>Most
              retail traders -- whether in crypto, Robinhood equities, FX, or elsewhere -- look
              a lot like gambling addicts. In crypto especially:</p>


            <ul>
              <li>Almost all retail
                traders have negative edge</li>
              <li>Crypto regularly
                turns lucky gamblers into rich people</li>
              <li>Even many “successful”
                discretionary traders are just beneficiaries of luck, not skill</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I
              am genuinely mystified by the behavior. How can Coinbase charge 2 percent fees and
              still have enormous volume? Why do people trade on venues like MEXC? Why are they
              trading at all?</p>

            <p>From
              the outside, it looks less like investing or skill acquisition and more like a mix
              of entertainment, lottery-ticket thinking, and addiction. For most people, the dominant
              strategy is not to find a better exchange, a better indicator, or a better strategy.
              It is simply not to play.</p>

            <p><strong id="dont-trade-options">Especially Don't Trade TradFi Options or Structured Products</strong></p>

            <p>If
              there is one category of trading retail should <i>especially</i> avoid, it is traditional
              finance options and structured products.</p>

            <p>Robinhood
              makes a huge amount of money from options trading. Wealth management firms make
              a huge amount of money selling options and exotic structures. That fact alone should
              tell you who is winning. The flip side is simple: you, the buyer, are getting hosed.</p>

            <p>At
              a fundamental level, any edge available to retail traders in TradFi is going to
              be small. It usually comes from taking on some hard-to-hold risk or trading in a
              niche market that institutions do not care enough about. If you believe you are
              routinely finding large, clean edges in listed options as a retail trader, you are
              wrong and should stop trading.</p>

            <p>Option
              markets are dominated by wide spreads, adverse selection, and professional counterparties.
              The bid-ask alone is often large enough to swamp any edge a retail trader could
              plausibly have. Whatever you think you have discovered is almost certainly already
              priced, and priced aggressively.</p>

            <p>Many
              people believe options reduce risk. They do not reduce risk; they transfer it. When
              you buy options, you are paying someone else -- usually a hedge fund or a market
              maker -- to take risk you do not want. As a retail investor, you are not going to
              win that trade on average.</p>

            <p>This
              is not an argument for covered calls either. Covered calls are just the mirror image:
              you are selling risk back to the same institutional players, either directly or
              at prices set by a market maker whose business is trading against much more sophisticated
              participants. You are still the weak side of the trade.</p>

            <p>I
              am posting this because I see crypto traders -- some of whom I believe actually
              have alpha -- buying TradFi options. In my view, they are lighting money on fire.
              There is a reason some surgeons refer to motorcyclists as “organ donors.” That is
              roughly how many TradFi professionals think about retail options and structured
              product traders.</p>

            <p>One
              important caveat: this logic applies much less to crypto. Crypto options are often
              mispriced, sometimes badly. In crypto, strategies that would be a punchline in TradFi
              can actually work. Python HFT is a good example. The market structure, participants,
              and level of sophistication are simply very different.</p>

            <p>But
              in TradFi options and structured products, the conclusion is straightforward: do
              not trade them.</p>

            <p><strong id="fundamental-edge">What Is Your Fundamental Edge?</strong></p>

            <p>You should understand why you made money (if you did) or at least how you could hope to
              make money.</p>

            <ol>
              <li> You understand the ebb and flow of markets and take concentrated, unhedged exposure based
                on information.
                This requires being deeply plugged in to everything, all the time.
                Examples include @0xAnteater, @TheCryptoNexus, @izebel_eth, @NMTD8.
                The catch: most people who think they are here are wrong. </li>
              <li> You are extremely good at execution. Examples include @laurentzimes and @liquiditygoblin. 
                This is extremely hard. I am very good but stopped (on Hyperliquid) 
                because it became too difficult.
                Goblin is often described as “the smartest person I've ever met.”  </li>
              <li>You are good at
                understanding risk and taking diversified, unhedged exposure. 
                An example is @ScottPh77711570.   This is  less hard technically than execution, but it is very hard mentally. 
                Drawdowns are  painful, and most people cannot cope with
                them. </li>
              <li>You are very                good at reading the fucking manual.                I put myself in this bucket.
                The problem is that this rarely scales: the important manuals already have
                a dozen people who read them carefully.</li>
              <li>You are a lucky
                degen. This is much easier in crypto than in TradFi, but it is still a mostly negative-sum
                game. Even worse, wins inspire a confidence that causes most degens to  give it all back, and then some. </li>
              <li>You were in the  right place at the right time.
                This applies to me and to most OGs to some extent.
                The issue is that you usually aren't.       That said,  crypto right now is inefficient enough that there is money
                lying around to be picked up.</li>
              <li>You move
                markets by using followers as exit liquidity.
                Plenty of examples exist. It's hard to build up followers to fleece, and fleecing your followers makes you either an oblivious moron or a colossal
                asshole.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>If  you think you make money through some way that isn't above, that's a bad sign. </p>

            <p>More
              practically, what should a retail trader do if they want to get better?</p>

            <p><b>Benchmark
              </b></p>

            <p>If
              you want any hope of winning, you need to identify what works and do more of
              it. To do that, you need benchmarking. Buying GOONCOIN because you thought it
              was a great meme and then winning because of an inflation print doesn't mean
              you have skill – it's just luck. You need to try to figure out  whether the decision-making
              process behind that bet had positive expected value. </p>

            <p>Two
              simple ways to improve this immediately:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Denominate
                  trades in the relevant ecosystem.</b>
                If you're trading alts, measure performance in ETH or SOL, not USD.</li>
              <li><b>Use pair
                  trades (or at least benchmark).</b>
                For example, long HYPE / short BNB. This bakes the benchmark in and forces
                you to isolate what you think your edge actually is.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Stop
                using strategies that imply you can predict the broad market</b></p>

            <p>Here's
              an analogy. Suppose a friend tells you they've figured out how to turn lead into
              gold using household chemicals. If you know even a little chemistry or history,
              you know they're wrong. You don't need to see the formula. People have tried this
              for millennia and failed, and we understand why.</p>

            <p>Predicting
              short-term movements in the broad stock market is similar. It's not impossible,
              but it is extremely hard. People get paid millions of dollars a year to predict
              it <i>slightly</i> better than chance. If your strategy implies you can do it reliably,
              you are wrong.</p>

            <p><b>Stop
                obsessing over cost basis</b></p>

            <p>Whether
              a position is good or bad has nothing to do with what you paid for it or how much
              you've already lost. Cost basis is sunk. It is irrelevant.</p>

            <p>People
              hate realizing losses, so they let losers grow. Then they blow up.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="card-body">

            <p>For
              individuals engaged in active trading, establishing a corporate structure can offer
              meaningful advantages in both tax treatment and legal risk management. In many jurisdictions,
              traders operate through an operating company owned by a holding company, a structure
              that is fairly common and well understood by professionals. The primary benefits
              are twofold. First, corporate entities may allow for tax deferral or modest reductions
              in the effective tax rate. Second, losses or negative balances incurred by the operating
              company are typically ring-fenced, meaning they cannot be charged against the holding
              company or the trader personally, provided the structure is set up and maintained
              correctly.</p>

            <p>That
              said, which structures work - and which do not - is highly region-specific. Tax
              law, securities regulation, and corporate liability rules vary widely across countries
              and even across sub-national jurisdictions. A sensible approach is to use tools
              like ChatGPT to sketch out the broad pros and cons of potential structures and to
              identify the types of professionals who are best suited to advise on them. From
              there, one can ask their personal or professional network to help identify reputable
              experts with relevant experience.</p>

            <p>It
              is also important to speak with multiple professionals on at least an introductory
              basis. Comparing advice helps reveal both consensus views and potential red flags.
              Once those relationships are established, general questions can again be routed
              through ChatGPT, reserving paid professional time for issues that truly require
              bespoke legal or tax advice.</p>

            <p>Finally,
              expectations should be kept firmly in check. Proper structuring can reduce legal
              liability, allow for tax deferral, and modestly lower the overall tax burden. It
              is not a magic solution. Professionals operating in offshore financial centers often
              promise far more aggressive outcomes, but such arrangements frequently carry substantial
              legal and regulatory risk, including the possibility of serious criminal penalties.
              Conservative, well-documented structures may be less exciting, but they are far
              more likely to achieve the intended benefits without creating new and far more severe
              problems.</p>

            <p>Many
              builders end up in a position where they want active liquidity on their platform.
              They need someone who will quote prices for the thing they've dreamed up, keep inventory,

            <p>Many
              builders assume pointing to an API spec is enough, but that's a mistake. Figuring
              out signing by yourself is always a massive pain. Because of that, I am very reluctant
              to integrate with a platform that lacks a proper SDK.</p>

            <p>Making
              an SDK is a version of dogfooding. If someone on your team can't quickly put together

            <p>In
              the age of chat GPT, the language of the SDK doesn't really matter. I'd suggest
              either Python with type hints or TS to hit the widest possible audience.</p>

            <p>**Actionable
              Suggestion:** Post an SDK that covers the basic methods of your protocol. </p>

            <p>**Role

              I'm quoting on your platform, I'm going to be taking existing stuff (e.g., HL) and
              making whatever changes are needed. Every deviation from the norm adds a cost. Minimize
              unnecessary changes.</p>

            <p>**Actionable
              Suggestion:** Follow existing players unless you have a good reason not to. </p>

            <p>**Role
              Model:** Hyperliquid did a good job here - USDT indexes, a similar funding formula
              to Binacne, and an AWS tokyo location made it easy to port Binance quotes over.
              Something like Kraken Futures is an anti-role model: 24-hour factor futures with
              unclear indices quoted in Europe is a nightmare for no good reason.</p>

            <p><strong>Consider a Taker Speedbump</strong></p>

            <p>Slowing
              down taker orders by 100ms (e.g., Hyperliquid) makes it a lot easier to set up a
              market making bot because you do not need to worry about being picked off by sniping
              bots.</p>

            <p><strong>Completely Describe of Cash Flows</strong></p>

            <p>If
              you want me to provide reasonable price quotes, you need to provide an exact and
              detailed description of the cash flows of the assets being traded.</p>

            <p>**Actionable
              Suggestion:** Take two similar products, review their documentation, and ensure
              yours covers everything they do. Information buried in Discord chats is not sufficient.</p>

            <p>**Role
              Model:**  Skimming through platforms, Hyperliquid's docs are okay. Kraken Futures
              is poor. Whales Market is horrible.</p>

            <p><strong>Convey Trustworthiness</strong></p>

            <p>Everyone
              needs confidence that their funds are safe. Personally, I look for backers I know
              (VCs and ideally community members), a doxxed team, and a track record.</p>

            <p><strong>Specific asks</strong></p>

            <p>In
              order of priority:
              <li>API keys. I don't want to have to store keys with withdraw access remotely.
              <li>Telegraphed changes. If I have a position in a contract and you change the contract,
                I lose money. Even worse, if I don't realize there is a change I might be quoting
                wrong and someone might take me to the cleaners.
              <li>Informative error messages. Probably obvious.
              <li>Clear information on rate limits. It's incredibly common for an MM to hit rate limits
                and then be a sitting duck and have all their orders picked off.
              <li>Deadman switches or order expirations. If my system crashs (e.g., because of your
                system sending me garbage) or hits a hidden rate limit (above), I don't want to
                lose a bunch of money.
              <li>Multisig (this only matters at later stages).

            <p><strong>Show Growth</strong></p>

            <p>Everyone
              wants growth, so this isn't really actionable. But realize that a lot of the integration
              costs are a one-time cost. If I'm earning that dividend over a long time, it's a
              much easier sell.</p>

            <p>The
              returns to integration increase as the platform grows. If your growth is stagnant
              or uncertain, the cost of integration becomes harder to justify.</p>

            <p><strong>Provide the information needed to assess profitability</strong></p>

            <p>The
              liquidity provider's profitability is of course the most important thing. I'm not
              saying much here because I don't want to leak too much alpha to other MM. </p>

            <p>My
              suggestion here is just to provide information easily. Don't tell people to enquire
              about the MM program on Discord and then reply three days later. Put it in the docs.</p>

            <p>EG:
              If you want better funding rates... make sure you have a funding rate history end
              point to make life easy for funding arbers. Even better, put together a funding
              rate comparison page (e.g., <a

            <p>I've
              seen a few posts recently about Lighter, the hot zero-fee perpetuals DEX, and its
              future business model. One post that triggered me (and this essay) argued that good
              market makers earn 10 basis points per trade—so the platform can just 'charge
              them' and call it a business model. That logic doesn't hold up. Let's unpack
              why. </p>

            <p>Before
              anything else: I like Lighter. I've ranked it in the tier just below Binance, Hyperliquid
              (HL), and Bybit in my perp exchange rankings <a href="https://stalequant.github.io/bot_view.html"
                target="_blank">here</a>. It isn't a
              primary
              venue for me, but it
              is one of literally two new venues I trade on and I currently have millions in notional
              open interest there and a few thousand dollars' worth of points. I prefer Hyperliquid,
              but I admit my biases. </p>

            <p>My
              goal here isn't to FUD Lighter. It's to lay out what I see as economic realities
              of the sector. </p>
            <p><strong id="market-makers-barely-make-it">Market Makers Barely Make It</strong></p>

            <p>If
              a platform promises free trades for users, someone still has to pay the bills. The
              obvious candidate is market makers (MMs). Hence the argument: just charge them.
            </p>

            <p>The
              problem? 'Good' market makers make maybe 1bp before cost, plus a bit from
              rebates. You can check this yourself: take the largest MMs on Hyperliquid, divide
              their P&amp;L by their trading volume, subtract the maker rebates, and you'll see
              something around 1bp. (Make sure to exclude spot, since the HYPE airdrop and HYPE
              holding profit distorts the math.) </p>

            <p>That
              1bp is gross profit. It doesn't include the cost of actually running a market-making
              operation: </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                hedging risk on other venues or facing drawdowns,
              <li>
                paying engineers and quants,
              <li>
                deploying millions in capital (and possibly staking more),
              <li>
                managing contract risk, platform risk, and the risk of being attacked,
              <li>
                paying AWS, data uplinks, and infrastructure costs.
            </ul>

            <p>None
              of that is free.</p>

            <b>Taxes on Market Makers Go Straight to Spreads</b>

            <p>If
              MMs are barely breaking even, what happens when you charge them? They widen their
              spreads. A 10bp maker fee becomes a 20bp bid–ask spread. You could see this clearly
              on Kraken, which historically had high maker fees and correspondingly wide spreads.
            </p>

            <p>That's
              why most exchanges do the opposite: they pay maker rebates. Hyperliquid pays 0.3bp,
              and many venues pay even more. Charging MMs is fighting gravity—it pushes spreads
              up, liquidity down, and retail away. </p>
            <p><strong id="robinhood-model">Robinhood Isn't What You Think</strong></p>

            <p>You
              might challenge what I'm saying and point out that Robinhood makes money on equity
              trades: If they make money on zero-fee TSLA trades, why can't Lighter make money
              on BTC perps? </p>

            <p>But
              actually PFOF on equity isn't a core part of Robinhood's model. Their profits come
              from: </p>

            <ul>
              <li>0.5% crypto fees
                (even Robinhood isn't using the 'Robinhood' model on crypto),

              <li>massive PFOF
                on options, and

              <li>interest income
                on idle balances.
            </ul>
            <p>Don't
              take my word for it—check the filings. Roughly 40% of Robinhood's trading volume
              is equities, yet equities produce only about 6% of revenue. Within that, large-cap
              names like TSLA contribute disproportionatelylittle. </p>
            <p><strong id="pfof-spreads">PFOF Works Because of Spreads</strong></p>

            <p>PFOF
              works when you can segment traders and share part of a wide spread. </p>

            <p>In
              TradFi, suppose a stock has a $100 / $101 bid–ask. That $1 spread covers market
              makers' risk of being run over by smarter traders. They make money when uninformed
              ('dumb') traders buy at $101 and lose money when informed ones buy before
              news hits $102. </p>

            <p>If
              you can separate the dumb flow, you can offer it a better price—say $100.8 instead
              of $101—while still earning a profit. The leftover margin can be shared between
              the broker and the market maker. </p>

            <p>No
              spread, no PFOF.</p>
            <p><strong id="crypto-spreads">Crypto Spreads Are Tiny, So PFOF Doesn't Work</strong></p>

            <p>Crypto
              perps don't have that room. Spreads are microscopic. If BTC trades at 100,000.12
              / 100,000.13, there's simply no economic space to pay for order flow. </p>

            <p>That's
              why, again, Robinhood earns little from equities. Equity trading dominates volume
              but not profits. Within equities, tiny small caps with wide spreads generate most
              of the PFOF revenue (e.g., here: <a
                href="https://brokerchooser.com/education/news/data-dashboard/payment-for-order-flow">https://brokerchooser.com/education/news/data-dashboard/payment-for-order-flow</a>).
              In crypto perps, there's no equivalent—spreads are too tight to extract meaningful
              value. </p>
            <p><strong id="retail-flow">Retail Flow Has Value, But Isn't Magic and Is Hard on DEXs</strong></p>

            <p>Segmenting
              users does help, even if you aren't giving them price improvement like PFOF. 'Bucket
              shop' CEXs like M*** or B***** do this aggressively—by banning or throttling
              skilled traders to protect the flow of the people dumb enough to use their platforms.
              That's one way to keep spreads profitable: kick out the smart money. </p>

            <p>DEXs
              can't do that. One thing they can do is play around with the microstructure. Hyperliquid
              was one of the first to add taker speed bumps and many venues (incl. Lighter I believe)
              have followed their leads. A short delay blunts toxic taker strategies without hurting
              normal users much, allowing tighter spreads for everyone else. </p>

            <p>That's
              fairer than banning good traders—but there's a ceiling and I think current speedbumps
              are already at that. DEXs can't stop anonymous addresses or shady on-chain behavior.
              Toxic flow is part of the game. I've personally been carried out by insider flow
              on DEXs; it happens. Unless Lighter has a new way to handle that, these constraints
              remain. </p>
            <p><strong id="microstructure-pisses-users">Going Further With Microstructure Tricks Will Piss Off
                Users</strong></p>

            <p>You
              can go beyond speed bumps and build hidden subsidies into the system—essentially
              transferring a few extra bp from takers to makers. </p>

            <p>That
              sounds appealing. But, I think Hyperliquid's microstructure is about as 'screwy'
              as users will take - and Hyperliquid's MMs are earning a 1.3bp profit including
              a maker rebate. Cranking the knobs further risks turning your venue into what feels
              like a 'rigged game.' </p>

            <p>And
              it's important to distinguish this from PFOF. PFOF gives users better prices through
              segmentation. Microstructure gimmicks (beyond segmentation) usually do the opposite
              and gives worse fills despite zero fees. </p>

            <p><strong id="zero-fees-wont-last">Even If Zero Fees Work Now, They Won't Forever</strong></p>

            <p>It's
              possible Lighter currently charges MMs modest fees and they're happily paying. That
              doesn't make it sustainable. </p>

            <p>I've
              been there. Years ago, I was the #2 or 3 MM on a platform that launched with zero
              fees and point rewards. I happily ran tight spreads and farmed the point farmers.
              Then points ended, a small fee was added, and the flow turned toxic. Spreads widened,
              volume cratered, and the venue faded. </p>

            <p>Lot's
              of stuff works when you are pumping money into the system.</p>

            <p><strong id="zero-fees-how">How Can Exchanges Fund Zero Fees?</strong></p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Charge MMs and let them pass it to users via wider spreads. Users
                won't love that.
              <li>
                Charge MMs but pay them back in tokens. Works short term, ends with
                heavy dilution (see: VERTEX).
              <li>
                Hide the costs via microstructure tricks. Might fool users temporarily;
                long-term, it erodes trust.
              <li>
                Find other revenue streams—like Robinhood's interest income. Feasible,
                but doesn't support high valuations.
              <li>
                Charge modest retail fees. Boring but sustainable—and the normal competitive
                equilibrium anyway.
            </ul>

            <p>More
              generally, I'm not convinced that
              'zero fees' are a strong selling point for perp traders. My impression:
              they care more about UI, reputation, farming, liquidity, leverage, and market access,
              with fees being less important. That's actually GOOD news for Lighter in a way:
              it suggests their success
              is driven by things other than simply being cheap. </p>

            <p><strong id="bottom-line">The Bottom Line</strong></p>

            <p>Crypto
              just doesn't have the wide spreads or clean flow segmentation that make PFOF viable
              elsewhere. Unless Lighter invents a genuinely new way to extract value—beyond rebates,
              points, or stealth microstructure tweaks—it's hard to see how the math works out.
            </p>

            <p>None
              of this means Lighter will fail. They have a good product and a good team. I just
              don't see PFOF or zero fees more generally as viable paths forward, unless Lighter
              invents a genuinely new way to extract value—beyond rebates, points, or stealth

            Exchange Structure:
            <span id="trans">Transparency in Trading</span>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">

            <p>Concerns
              about transparency in electronic markets, especially on venues like Hyperliquid,
              often center on fears of predation. Traders worry that their positions, stop-losses,
              or liquidation levels are visible and actively exploited. Based on what I have seen,
              these concerns are frequently overstated. I expected to find clear evidence that
              detailed trader positioning or liquidation data was being systematically incorporated
              into the order book. Instead, I found very little. Many liquidations that get attributed
              to being “hunted” tend to coincide with broad market events, such as a weak NYSE
              open or an inflation print, rather than targeted behavior.</p>

            <p>That
              said, transparency should create winners and losers. This is not a bug; it is the
              point. The question is who loses. The main groups are traders with extremely toxic
              information, such as insiders trying to quietly unload positions; traders with very
              large positions, where direction and size themselves convey information; and traders
              whose edge is so obvious that it can be easily copied once revealed.</p>

            <p>For
              the first two groups, the real cost of transparency shows up during the accumulation
              phase. If others can infer that you are building a position, they can move the price
              against you before you finish. For the third group, the intuition is that transparency
              should be damaging, but in practice it often is not. High-frequency strategies are
              extremely hard to reverse-engineer from order flow alone. Discretionary skill is
              also difficult to identify from trading history, and when others do attempt to copy
              successful traders, they often end up pushing prices in the original trader's favor.
              The uncomfortable corollary is that traders without edge sometimes attribute losses
              to transparency rather than to the absence of skill.</p>

            <p>Most
              traders, however, benefit from transparency. Giving worse prices to toxic or highly
              informative flow necessarily improves prices for everyone else. This is the same
              logic that underpins payment for order flow. Algorithmic traders should generally
              not worry about being copied, and discretionary traders with real skill should not
              worry much about information leakage. Those concerns are usually overstated.</p>

            <p>The
              popularity of dark trading venues is also widely misunderstood. Much of the migration
              off-exchange is not about privacy itself. Payment for order flow is mostly about
              the nature of the orders, not concealing information. Dark pools are attractive
              largely because they offer lower fees and midpoint execution, which is partly regulatory
              arbitrage. These structural features explain far more than secrecy alone.</p>

            <p>Importantly,
              transparency does not mean that all execution must be public. There are straightforward
              ways to keep TWAPs, stop-losses, and conditional orders private. Hyperliquid does
              not currently emphasize this, likely because the team believes this functionality
              should live in third-party front ends rather than in the core protocol.</p>

            <p>More
              broadly, Hyperliquid has room to further mitigate transparency concerns through
              structural changes such as transferable positions. If implemented well, this could
              materially improve execution quality, even for very large accounts, and potentially
              offer a better experience than centralized exchanges.</p>

            <p>There
              is one transparency issue that is more specific to Hyperliquid. Once mempools become
              public, the interaction between visible taker orders and the taker speed bump starts
              to resemble MEV on an order book. For example, makers may pull top-of-book liquidity
              when they see a large taker order coming. This is solvable, but it is genuinely
              more difficult than the other issues.</p>

            <p>In
              many ways, Hyperliquid already looks more like off-exchange trading than a traditional
              exchange. Its microstructure reduces toxicity, and participants have some ability
              to know who they are trading with, similar to dark pools, private rooms, or
              payment-for-order-flow
              arrangements. Contrary to common narratives, much off-exchange trading exists not
              because traders want to hide who they are, but because they want to reveal it. Robinhood
              users get good execution precisely because their flow signals low toxicity. ETFs
              rebalance via RFQs because their trades are predictable and non-informative. Traders
              choose venues to avoid being picked off by snipers and HFTs.</p>

            <p>Seen
              this way, transparency is not the enemy of good execution. With thoughtful market
              design, it is often the mechanism that makes good execution possible in the first
              place.</p>

              makes it very easy to win big, and even easier to gamble it all away. I've been
              in some bad places myself, but I was able to make it a lot better with time and
              effort. Even if you think it's all over, talk to someone and wait a week. If
              you are right and if it's all over, what's a week? But maybe you are wrong.</p>

            <p>No
